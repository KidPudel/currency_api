# Endpoints
Basically we should be interested in 2 things:
1. where is the converter?
2. where is the docs

## Converter
Example: https://currencyapi-production.up.railway.app/currency-rate?from_currency=RUB&to_currency=USD&amount=5000

Response:
```json
{
	"success": true,
	"sum": 56.6842,
	"from": "RUR",
	"to": "USD"
}
```

> Why returned RUR? Because that's what external server uses, but i've done some filtering and adjustments, so that it would be more convenient.
> P.S. Also it's case insensitive ;)
